#### Bulk import

The script provides a way to bulk import the candles for all defined trading pairs. Thanks to [macd2](https://forum.jesse.trade/d/83-bulk-candle-import) user.

To start, set up: exchange, start_date, and pairs inside the `bulk_import.py` file, then type:

```
python bulk_import.py
```

#### FinTA (Financial Technical Analysis)

See `FintaExamples` strategy to see how to connect third party technical indicators library [FinTA](https://github.com/peerchemist/finta). In FinTA, there're some indicators that are not on the official Jesse's [list](https://docs.jesse.trade/docs/indicators/reference.html).



To run, type: `jesse backtest 2020-12-01 2020-12-31 --debug`
